     Day 4
        array
                 - array help organize multiple values under a single name.
                 - indexing starts at 0,which means the first element is at position 0.
                 - we can easily access,modify,or add items to an array

     Day 5 
        when to use map
                 - input and output (both array)
                 -  and input and output length is same
                 - [1,2,3]=[2,3,6]  (we can ue map)
                 - [1,2,3]=[2,3,6,8]  (we can not use map) because output and input length does not macth
                 - ["s","u","j","a","n"] => ["S","u","j","a","n"]  can use map
                 -  "sujan" => ["S","u","j","a","n"]  can not use map
                 - ["S","u","j","a","n"] =>"sujan  can not use map
       when to use filter
               - input and output must be array 
               -  is used to filter element 
                - output element are from the input element
                 - [1,2,3]=>[1,2]  can use filter 
                  - [1,2,3]=>[4,1] can not use filter 
                 - "sujan"=>"suj" can not use filter
     import and export
          how to write path
                . means its own folder
                .. means parent folder
                / is used to say arko

          example 1: lets import anything from a file
                   src
                       a.js
                       b.js
                       folder1
                            c.js
                            folder2
                                d.js    "../../a.js"
          which is the folder of d
          which is the folder of folder2
          which is the parent of folder2

          example 2 lets import any thing from c filter
                        src
                            a.js
                            b.js
                            folder1
                                  c.js
                                  folder2
                                       d.js      "../c.js"
          example 3 lets import any thing from d (a)
                           src
                              a.js   "./folder1/folder2/d.js"
                              b.js
                              folder1
                                   c.js
                                   folder2
                                        d.js
