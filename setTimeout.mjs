//setTimeout is a function that takes two arguments, a callback function and a time in milliseconds. 
// The callback function is called after the time has passed. In this case, the callback function logs
//  the message to the console after 2 seconds. The rest of the code
//  continues to execute while the setTimeout function is waiting. 
// This is why "sujan" and "kiran" are logged to the console before the message from the setTimeout function.
